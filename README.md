## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

The purpose of this analysis was to use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.
The dataset included Loan Size, Interest Rate, Borrower Income, Debt to Income Ratio, Number of Accounts, Derogatory Marks, Total Debt, and their Creditworthiness. The goal of the analysis was to predict a borrower's Creditworthiness using the other provided variables.  The dataset included 75,036 borrowers that were considered creditworthy, and 2500 borrowers that were identified as risky borrowers.

In order to prepare for the machine learning process, we split the dataset into training data and test data, and then created Logistic Regression Models (one with the original dataset, one that was resampled in order to better balance the training data between creditworthy and risky borrowers).


## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1 (created balanced dataset:
  * Model 1 



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
